# Amazon-sales-data-analysis-using-Google-sheet
ðŸš€ I'm thrilled to share a comprehensive sales dashboard I built using Google Sheets to analyze my Amazon store's performance. In todayâ€™s fast-paced e-commerce landscape, making data-driven decisions is crucial for sustained growth. This dashboard was designed to provide a comprehensive overview of our Amazon sales performance over the last quarter. 
This dashboard includes:
*Sales Distribution across different product categories
*Top 5 Sub-Categories by sales
*KPIs comparing sales and profit with last year (2016)
*Regional Sales Breakdown across North, South, East, and West
*Customer Segment Contributions to Overall Sales
*Insights on Top 10 Frequently Returned Products
*Top 10 Customers with the highest number of purchases
*Top 10 Most Frequently Bought Items
Leveraging Google Sheets' powerful features, this dashboard provides valuable insights to optimize product offerings and enhance customer satisfaction.
